I am a PhD student in sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. My research interests center around how changing social, economic, and demographic conditions in the United States have led to increased inequalities at work and at home. In a paper co-authored with Daniel Schneider and Orestes P. Hastings (forthcoming in _American Sociological Review_), we document the role of increased income inequality in explaining increased class gaps in parental investments in children, and investigate the mechanisms that underlie this relationship. I am also currently working on two other projects in this area: one which decomposes the increases in class gaps in total parental childcare time (as opposed to maternal or paternal childcare time) into its various sources, and another which tests how the effect of local economic conditions on within-job volatility in weekly working hours varies by class.

I have also published on the determinants of risk-taking at large commercial banks in the United States (forthcoming in _Social Science Quarterly_), and, in my previous job at the Federal Reserve Board, I worked on a paper (with Luca Guerrieri and Martin Bodenstein) estimating the gains from international cooperation in setting monetary policy.
